    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Performance Management System in Private Sector</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Performance management is crucial for management accounting, acting as a four-stage solution for achieving sustainability in the private sector:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Determine and ensure appropriate organizational structure.</li>
        <li>Evaluate delegation of control and identify responsibility centers.</li>
        <li>Establish financial and non-financial performance measures and targets.</li>
        <li>Review performance (using KPI Dashboard) and take corrective action.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">**Responsibility Accounting** is an information subsystem of Performance Management, collecting and reporting data where managers are accountable for costs, revenue, or assets under their control. Its effectiveness is linked to organizational structure and the degree of delegated authority.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Interlinking of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">For an efficient performance management system, identifying CSFs and establishing corresponding KPIs and targets is essential. CSFs are vital aspects for achieving strategic objectives (e.g., profitability, market share, quality).</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">**KPIs** are performance management instruments used to measure and monitor the achievement of objectives, indicating the level of success. CSFs are the critical areas, while KPIs are the signals of performance in those areas.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">How to Identify CSFs and KPIs (Rockart's Sources):</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Structure of a particular Industry.</li>
        <li>Competitive strategy, industry position, and geographical location.</li>
        <li>Environmental Factors.</li>
        <li>Temporary Influences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">KPIs should be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound). A single CSF can have multiple KPIs.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-2">Exploiting CSFs using core competencies leads to competitive advantages.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Performance Measures</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Ideal performance measures support corporate strategy, cover financial/non-financial, quantitative/qualitative aspects, aid decision-making, recognize long-term/short-term objectives, incentivize managers (goal congruence), and include only controllable factors.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">1. Financial Performance Measures:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Essential for profitability, growth, and survival. Readily available, understood by managers, and useful for comparisons.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Gross Profit:** $\text{Net Sale} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$. Gross Profit Margin = $(\text{Gross Profit} / \text{Sales}) \times 100$. Useful for product profitability issues.</li>
        <li>**Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** $(\text{PBIT} / \text{Average Capital Employed}) \times 100$. Measures capital productivity. Can discourage capital investment if PBIT doesn't increase proportionally.</li>
        <li>**Return on Investment (ROI):** Similar to ROCE, used for divisional performance (Investment Centres). Can lead to lack of goal congruence if divisional ROI conflicts with overall company ROI.</li>
        <li>**Residual Income (RI):** $\text{Controllable Profit} - (\text{Predetermined Minimum Hurdle Rate} \times \text{Investment Controllable})$. Overcomes ROI's dysfunctional consequences by encouraging goal congruence. Absolute measure, not ideal for comparing divisions of different sizes.</li>
        <li>**Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $\text{Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders} / \text{Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding}$. Easily understood by shareholders, but weak correlation with shareholder wealth and can be distorted by accounting policies.</li>
        <li>**Economic Value Added (EVA):** $\text{NOPAT} - (\text{WACC} \times \text{Capital Employed})$. Measures economic profit, accounting for the cost of equity capital. Aims to overcome limitations of accounting profit. Also an absolute measure, largely based on historical data.</li>
        <li>**Net Present Value (NPV):** $\text{PV of Cash Inflow} - \text{PV of Cash Outflow}$. Strong correlation with shareholder wealth, considers time value of money and all cash flows. Can be complex and relies on assumptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">2. Non-Financial Performance Measures:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Crucial for long-term viability, addressing shortcomings of purely financial measures (short-term orientation, historical, internal focus, manipulation). Tools like Balanced Scorecard, Performance Pyramid, Building Block Model, and Triple Bottom Line integrate non-financial aspects.</p>
    <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-700 mb-2">Example: Scope of NFPI for specific functions:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Human Resources:** Staff turnover, absentee rate, job satisfaction, offer letter acceptance.</li>
        <li>**Quality of Product and Service:** Value creation, competitive comparison, innovation scope.</li>
        <li>**Brand Equity:** Customer awareness, loyalty, perceived quality, R&D image.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">3. Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan & Norton):</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Displays organizational performance across four perspectives, linking financial and non-financial measures, internal and external aspects, and long-term/short-term objectives to overall strategy.</p>
    <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-700 mb-2">Four Perspectives:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Financial Perspective:** "How Do We Look to Shareholders?" (Revenue, earnings, ROI).</li>
        <li>**Customer Perspective:** "How Do Customers View Us?" (Satisfaction, retention, acquisition, loyalty, on-time delivery, defects).</li>
        <li>**Internal Business Perspective:** "At What Must We Excel?" (Processes and activities to achieve financial/customer objectives, e.g., after-sales service).</li>
        <li>**Learning and Growth Perspective:** "How Do We Continue to Improve and Create Value?" (Employee capabilities, information systems, organizational procedures).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Discourages short-termism by giving equal importance to non-financial measures. Implementation can fail if managers misuse it or copy others' measures.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">4. Performance Pyramid (Cross & Lynch):</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">A four-level hierarchy integrating strategic objectives with operational performance, linking internal efficiency with external effectiveness. Superior to Balanced Scorecard in terms of hierarchy (senior managers set objectives for each level) and acknowledging financial/non-financial measures complement each other.</p>
    <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-700 mb-2">Levels:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**L-1 (Corporate Vision):** Long-term success.</li>
        <li>**L-2 (Market & Financial):** CSFs at SBU/division level.</li>
        <li>**L-3 (Customer Satisfaction, Flexibility, Productivity):** Strategic objectives.</li>
        <li>**L-4 (Quality, Delivery, Cycle Time, Waste):** Operational performance dimensions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">5. Building Block Model (Fitzgerald & Moon):</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Addresses performance measurement in service industries (applicable elsewhere). Based on three building blocks: Dimensions, Standards, and Rewards.</p>
    <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-700 mb-2">Building Blocks:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Dimensions:** Goals/CSFs (e.g., Quality, Flexibility, Innovation, Resource Utilization, Financial Performance, Competitive Performance).</li>
        <li>**Standards:** Measures/KPIs, must be equitable, owned, and achievable.</li>
        <li>**Rewards:** Schemes to motivate employees, must be clear and linked to controllable factors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Establishes an explicit link between corporate strategy achievement and human resource management.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">6. Triple Bottom Line (TBL) (Elkington):</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Expands traditional accounting to include social and environmental performance alongside financial profit. Focuses on 3Ps: People, Planet, and Profit, for sustainable development.</p>
    <h4 class="font-semibold text-slate-700 mb-2">Dimensions:</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Planet (Environmental):** Impact on resources, emissions, ecological footprints.</li>
        <li>**People (Social):** Corporate governance, human capital, human rights, ethical behavior.</li>
        <li>**Profit (Economic):** Shareholder value creation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">A sustainable decision is acceptable from all three perspectives. TBL uses a stakeholder approach and is a substitute for full cost accounting with a wider perspective.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">The Role of Quality in Performance Measurement Systems</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Quality differentiates products/services, improves performance, and gains competitive advantage. It can be defined as freedom from errors, adherence to design, fitness for use, or meeting customer needs.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">1. Effect of Quality Practices on PMS and Quality-Related Costs:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Quality practices enhance performance. Cost of Quality (CoQ) is divided into:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Cost of Conformance (Good Cost):** Prevention Cost (preventing errors) and Appraisal Cost (detecting errors).</li>
        <li>**Cost of Non-Conformance (Bad Cost):** Internal Failure Cost (errors before delivery) and External Failure Cost (errors after delivery).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Measuring quality costs (CSFs and KPIs based on CoQ) influences behavior towards quality practices.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">2. Role of Quality Management System (QMS) as Support to PMS:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">A QMS directs and controls an organization's performance for continuous improvement. The total cost of conformance is the expense of maintaining a QMS. Rigor of QMS is inversely related to non-conformance costs.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">3. Role of Lean Production System as Support to PMS:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Lean production (cutting waste, unnecessary activities) improves performance by getting the right thing to the right place at the right time.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-6 mb-2">4. Quality in Management Information Systems (MIS):</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Good quality information (reliable, accurate, timely, objective, complete) helps management make informed decisions and effectively control business performance. Assured by a functional, reliable, interactive, and user-friendly MIS.</p>
