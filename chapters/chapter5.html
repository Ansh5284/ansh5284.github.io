    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Models Relevant to Sustainability</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Sustainable business models address social and environmental perspectives in addition to economic profitability. They incorporate value propositions with positive social and environmental offerings.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Three Dimensions of Sustainability:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Social:** Philanthropy, ethics, inclusion, diversity.</li>
        <li>**Environmental:** Carbon footprint, resource depletion.</li>
        <li>**Economic:** Revenue, profitability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Approaches for Developing Sustainable Business Models:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Product Service Systems:** Consumer pays for services of a product, not ownership (company responsible for full lifecycle).</li>
        <li>**Open Innovation:** Collaboration with external organizations/individuals to generate and commercialize new ideas.</li>
        <li>**Peer-to-peer innovation:** Collaboration of loosely connected individuals sharing open-source resources.</li>
        <li>**Closed-loop production:** Recycling materials throughout manufacturing, minimizing waste ('cradle to cradle').</li>
        <li>**Crowdfunding:** New funding source for niche innovation, attracting social media attention.</li>
        <li>**Sharing economy:** Participatory sharing schemes providing timely access to resources, efficient use of idle assets.</li>
        <li>**Social enterprises and benefit corporations:** Legally obligated to pursue social and environmental value alongside financial.</li>
        <li>**The gift economy:** Voluntary donations ('pay what you want'), capitalizing on social sustainability.</li>
        <li>**New manufacturing paradigm:** Driven by additive manufacturing (3D printing) for efficiency, rapid prototyping.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="emerging-national-markets" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Models Relevant to Emerging National Markets</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Emerging markets (e.g., India, China) are transitioning societies with rapid informatization, limited industrialization, and growing middle classes. They represent substantial global consumption opportunities but are often price-sensitive, requiring customized business models.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Characteristics of Emerging Markets (require customization in business models):</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Sociopolitical governance.</li>
        <li>Market heterogeneity.</li>
        <li>Inadequate infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Chronic shortage of resources.</li>
        <li>Unbranded competition.</li>
        <li>Prevalence of clientelistic exchange.</li>
        <li>Informal institutional flux.</li>
        <li>Channels of distribution challenges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Businesses targeting these markets must often rethink their models from scratch to create and capture value in new ways, acting like startups.</p>

<section id="strategic-responses" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Strategic Responses to New Business Models</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Successful business models require strategic responses to change drivers, especially root causes like digital technologies, business ecosystems, hyper-competition, and transformation/disruption. These cause drivers lead to new business models, while effect drivers are responses themselves.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Strategies Pertaining to Digital Technologies:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600">For startups, digital technologies are core to innovation and disruption. For incumbents, it's balancing optimizing existing products/markets with striving for innovation for sustainable growth.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Value-Based Strategy in a Business Ecosystem:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600">Strategy should dominate aspects of the ecosystem that create significant customer value. Strategic decisions involve investments in resources and capabilities to capture value.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Make the best out of changing customer needs.</li>
        <li>Be the locus of USP (reason customers buy the product).</li>
        <li>Be an indispensable integrator (e.g., app stores).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Strategic Aspects of Creating Ecosystem (Partnerships):</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Flexibility and cooperation with partners.</li>
        <li>Enhanced accountability (partners as stakeholders).</li>
        <li>Free (seamless) flow of information (transparency vs. trade secrets).</li>
        <li>Shared economy (clustering of firms, shared resources).</li>
        <li>Think of economics of scope apart from scale.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Focus on Series of Short-Term Advantages (Hyper-Competition):</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600">Continuously strive for short-term advantages through market disruption, moving to new disruptions as old ones mature. Requires constant innovation, R&D budget, lean start-up structure, and collaboration.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Strategic Response to Transformations and Disruptions:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600">Disruptions change the basis of competition. Failing to respond makes established organizations vulnerable. Strategies include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Milking as cash cow:** For vulnerable businesses, winding-up as last resort.</li>
        <li>**Invest or counter invest:** Strive for or respond to disruption with incremental investments.</li>
        <li>**Blocking the path or creating hurdle:** Innovators reserve IP rights; peers create hurdles.</li>
        <li>**Counter disruption:** Aggressive strategy where large players introduce another disruption.</li>
        <li>**Restrict presence and shift focus on core:** Redefine core capabilities and shift focus.</li>
        <li>**Withdraw:** Exit strategy, liquidating assets and diverting value to profitable businesses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Considerations for strategy selection: availability of resources, importance of segment, organizational capabilities, and trade-off between first-mover advantage and uncertainty.</p>
