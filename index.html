    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application now features a multi-chapter architecture. It starts with a 'Chapter Selection' view. Upon selecting a chapter, the main content area dynamically displays only that chapter's sections and its dedicated MCQ quiz. The left-hand sidebar navigation adapts to show the specific sections of the active chapter, along with a 'Back to Chapters' link. This structure facilitates modular content management and allows users to focus on one chapter at a time, enhancing navigability and reducing cognitive load. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Chapter Selection: Goal: Organize/Navigate -> Viz: Grid of clickable chapter cards -> Interaction: Click to load specific chapter content -> Justification: Provides a clear, visual entry point for multi-chapter content. -> Library: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Seven Wastes -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Interactive card grid -> Interaction: Click to reveal description -> Justification: Breaks down a list into a more engaging, explorable format. -> Library: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: 5S Methodology -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Interactive stepper diagram -> Interaction: Click on each 'S' to view details -> Justification: Visualizes the process flow better than text and encourages step-by-step learning. -> Library: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: OEE Calculation Example -> Goal: Inform/Interact -> Viz: Interactive Calculator with Gauge Charts -> Interaction: User inputs data to see real-time calculation of Availability, Performance, Quality, and overall OEE -> Justification: Turns a static calculation into a hands-on learning tool, deeply reinforcing the formula's components. -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Six Sigma Levels vs. Yield -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Viz: Interactive Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover to see detailed DPMO and Yield % -> Justification: Provides a clear visual comparison of the exponential improvement between sigma levels. -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: DMAIC vs DMADV -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Side-by-side comparison table -> Interaction: Static -> Justification: A clean table is the most effective way to compare features directly. -> Library: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: MCQ Test -> Goal: Assess/Reinforce -> Viz: Interactive Quiz -> Interaction: Select answers, navigate questions, submit for scoring and detailed rationale feedback. -> Justification: Provides an active learning component for self-assessment and deeper understanding of correct/incorrect reasoning. -> Library: HTML/CSS/JS.

The central idea of Lean, derived from the Toyota Production System, is to maximize customer value while minimizing waste. It's an organized management philosophy that transforms how a company operates by focusing on optimizing workflow, eliminating non-value-added activities, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Use the navigation to jump to a specific topic or scroll to explore how different methodologies contribute to this goal.</p>

                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">JIT is a 'pull' system aiming to produce or procure items exactly when they are required, not for stock. This minimizes inventory and its associated costs but requires a highly synchronized and reliable value chain. Successful implementation hinges on several prerequisites, such as predictable demand, total quality management, and efficient information systems.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Back-Flushing in JIT</h3>
                        <p class="text-slate-600">A key accounting innovation in JIT is back-flushing, where the cost of materials is charged to products only after they are completed. This simplifies costing by eliminating detailed tracking of materials through WIP. However, it demands extremely accurate production counts and diligent tracking of any abnormal scrap to maintain inventory accuracy.</p>

                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">Kaizen is a philosophy based on the belief that nothing is ever perfect and that continuous, small, incremental improvements are always possible. In costing, this translates to a system focused on achieving cost reduction targets through employee participation, rather than just maintaining a static standard.</p>

The goal is to create a smooth, one-piece flow, drastically reducing lead times, inventory, and space. A common U-shaped layout allows single operators to manage multiple machines and improves supervisor oversight.</p>

                    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">Six Sigma is a disciplined, data-driven approach for eliminating defects in any process. The goal is to reach a quality level of just 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO). The chart below visualizes the dramatic reduction in defects as the Sigma level increases. It uses two key methodologies: DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) for improving existing processes, and DMADV for designing new ones.</p>
