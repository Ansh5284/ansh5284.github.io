    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Cost Volume Profit (CVP) Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">CVP Analysis examines the interrelationships among revenues, costs, activity levels, and profits. It helps management determine production activity levels required to break-even or achieve a target profit. Traditionally, it classifies costs as variable and fixed with reference to volume.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6">Break-even point (in units) = $\frac{\text{Fixed Cost}}{\text{Sales per unit - Variable cost per unit}}$</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Activity Based CVP Analysis:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Conventional CVP assumes all non-volume costs are fixed. Activity-Based CVP refines this by classifying costs into a hierarchy based on their drivers:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Unit level (output) activities:** Vary directly with production volume (e.g., direct materials, direct labor).</li>
        <li>**Batch-level activities:** Vary with the number of batches, not individual units (e.g., machine setups, purchase orders).</li>
        <li>**Product sustaining activities:** Support a specific product type, not volume (e.g., product design, technical enhancements).</li>
        <li>**Facilities level activities:** General operations, cannot be traced to a particular product (e.g., factory rent, employee training).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Activity-Based CVP provides more precise understanding of cost behavior, leading to better decisions. The break-even point formula adapts to include non-volume driven costs:</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600">Break-even point (units) = $\frac{\text{Fixed cost + (batch level cost driver x cost per batch driver) + (product sustaining cost driver x cost per product sustaining cost driver)}}{\text{selling price per unit - variable cost per unit}}$</p>

<section id="relevant-cost-concepts" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Relevant Cost Concepts (Short-Term Decisions)</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Short-run decisions involve choosing among feasible alternatives within an immediate or limited time frame. These are often called tactical or relevant decisions and can have long-run consequences. They involve evaluating costs and benefits of short-term actions like make-or-buy, accepting special orders, or keeping/dropping segments.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">For a cost to be relevant, it must be:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**A future cost:** Related to the future.</li>
        <li>**A differential cost:** Its level must be different for each alternative under consideration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4 mb-4">Only future costs that differ between alternatives are relevant. Sunk costs (past costs) are irrelevant.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Ethical and Non-Financial Considerations:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Decision-making involves ethical considerations (honesty, fairness, consequences on others) and non-financial factors (quality, employee/customer satisfaction, CSR, environmental factors, brand name). Non-financial information is long-term focused, ensuring profitability and sustainability.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Decision-Making Model Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Define the problem.</li>
        <li>Identify alternatives, eliminating unfeasible ones.</li>
        <li>Identify the costs and benefits of each alternative.</li>
        <li>Examine the total relevant costs and benefits.</li>
        <li>Assess non-financial factors and ethical issues.</li>
        <li>Select the alternative with the greatest overall benefit.</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing Policy</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Pricing policy defines the principles for setting prices, aligning with corporate objectives and vision. It influences long-term survival, sales, and profit. While cost is important, consumer demand and competitive environment are often more significant determinants.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Pricing Policy and Relative Price Structure should:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Provide incentive for adopting improved technology & maximizing production.</li>
        <li>Encourage optimum utilization of resources.</li>
        <li>Work towards a better balance between demand and supply.</li>
        <li>Promote export.</li>
        <li>Avoid adverse effects on the rest of the economy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Pricing is the only element of the marketing mix that generates revenue and is a key determinant of profitability.</p>

<section id="pricing-decisions" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing Decisions</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Pricing decisions are crucial for a firm's long-term survival. They are influenced by internal factors (corporate objectives, product image, demand elasticity, costs, product life cycle stage, competition, product characteristics, production volume) and external factors (market composition, buyer attitude, bargaining power, competitor policy, economy, government regulations, societal considerations).</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Structured Approach to Pricing Decisions (Steps):</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Setting pricing objectives (aligned with marketing/organizational goals).</li>
        <li>Determining demand elasticity and estimating total market demand.</li>
        <li>Estimating manufacturing and marketing costs.</li>
        <li>Assessing customer's demand.</li>
        <li>Analyzing competitor's costs, prices, and offers.</li>
        <li>Selecting a pricing method (considering market shares, brand image, customer segments, life cycle).</li>
        <li>Selecting the final price.</li>
        <li>Periodical review of sales and adjusting prices.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Pricing Objectives:</h3>

<section id="product-pricing-theory" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Product Pricing Theory & Principles</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Micro-economic theory defines the optimum price as that which yields maximum profits (total revenues over total costs). Profit is maximized at the output level where Marginal Revenue (MR) equals Marginal Cost (MC).</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Pricing Under Different Market Structures:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Perfect Competition:** Many sellers, homogeneous product, perfect information. Firms are price takers; price determined by market.</li>
        <li>**Monopoly:** Single supplier, homogeneous product, no close substitutes. Firm is a price setter, but considers demand elasticity for maximum profit.</li>
        <li>**Monopolistic Competition:** Many firms, similar but not identical products. Excess profits attract new competition, diminishing profits. Firms compare MR and MC.</li>
        <li>**Oligopoly:** Few firms, homogeneous or identical products. Firms are mutually interdependent; consider rivals' reactions. Non-price competition is preferred (quality, advertising, sales promotion, loyalty schemes).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Principles of Product Pricing:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Price Customization:** Pricing based on customer taste, preference, perceived value (product line, past behavior, demographics, time differential).</li>
        <li>**Price Sensitivity:** Measures customer behavior to price changes. Factors include Unique Value Effect, Substitute Awareness Effect, Difficult Comparison Effect, Total Expenditure Effect, End-Benefit Effect, Shared Cost Effect, Sunk Investment Effect, Price Quality Effect, Inventory Effect.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="pricing-new-products" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing of New Products</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Pricing new products is challenging due to demand uncertainty. Experimental sales are often conducted. New products are categorized for pricing:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Revolutionary Product:** New to market, creates own value, revolutionary impact, enjoys premium price (reward for innovation).</li>
        <li>**Evolutionary Product:** Upgraded version with additional characteristics, priced considering cost-benefit, competitor, and demand.</li>
        <li>**Me-too Product:** Imitation of revolutionary/evolutionary products, market followers, price takers (price determined by competitive forces).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">New Product Pricing Strategies:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Skimming Pricing:** High prices early in product's existence (inelastic demand, skim cream, cover initial costs, finance high outlays). Gradually reduced later.</li>
        <li>**Penetration Pricing:** Low price to penetrate mass markets early (opposite of skimming). Aims for long-term survival, considerable research needed. Adopted when demand is elastic, substantial savings on large scale production, or threat of competition.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="pricing-methods-existing" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing Methods for Existing Finished Products</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Pricing methods are defined by costs, demand, and competition.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">1. Cost-Based Pricing Method:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Estimates product cost and adds a profit margin. Uses Full Cost (at current output/wages) or Variable Costs with a markup. Limitations include arbitrary overhead allocation and imprecise normal output estimation.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Mark-up pricing:** Adds a standard mark-up to production cost (usually variable cost). Price = Cost + Mark-up.</li>
        <li>**Target Rate of Return:** Determines average mark-up to achieve desired ROI. Price = Unit Cost + [(Desired Rate of Return * Invested Capital)/Number of unit sales].</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">2. Competition-Based Pricing Method:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Sets price based on competitors' charges (or market leader). Can be lower or higher (discount/premium pricing).</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Going Rate Pricing:** Keeps price at industry average. Useful when costs are hard to measure. Popular in homogeneous product markets (oil, gas, fertilizer).</li>
        <li>**Sealed Bid-Pricing:** Firms compete via bids (e.g., defense contracts). Objective is to win contract by bidding lower than competitors, but above marginal cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">3. Psychological Pricing:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Uses pricing to appeal to consumer psychology (e.g., ₹999 instead of ₹1,000). Known as Bata Pricing in India.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">4. Value-Based Pricing Method:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Prices product based on customer's perception of its value. Reduces threat of price wars.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Objective Value (True Economic Value - TEV):** Measures product benefits relative to alternatives. TEV = Cost of Next Best Alternative + Value of Performance Differential.</li>
        <li>**Perceived Value:** Value consumer understands product delivers; price consumer is willing to spend.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing of Services</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Services have inherent features: Intangibility, Inseparability, Variability, and Perishability. This leads to unique pricing issues.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Service Classifications:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**People Processing Service:** Customer physically present (e.g., haircut).</li>
        <li>**Product/Possession Processing Services:** Related to a specific product, limited customer involvement (e.g., packers and movers).</li>
        <li>**Mental Stimulus Processing Services:** Influence consumer's mental abilities/beliefs (e.g., watching a movie).</li>
        <li>**Information Processing Services:** Information acts as a product (e.g., buying insurance, consultancy).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Pricing must accommodate intangible costs, may be regulated (healthcare, education), or determined collectively (trade associations). Pricing can also balance demand (e.g., discounts for off-peak times).</p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Pricing decisions depend on the nature of the emerging business model.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Hyper Disruptive Business Models:** Pricing depends on underlying disruptions and imitation difficulty.</li>
        <li>**Models Relevant to Sustainability:** Pricing reflects social and environmental implications alongside economic ones.</li>
        <li>**Models Relevant to Emerging National Markets:** Value for money (cost-effective solutions) is key due to price sensitivity (e.g., India, Brazil).</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Sensitivity Analysis in Pricing Decisions</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Sensitivity analysis is crucial for striking the right balance between generating sales and profitability. It determines how sales and costs respond to changes in market conditions (external factors like demand, market prices, exchange rates) and internal factors (initial outlay, R&D, production costs, marketing costs, product prices).</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600">It helps understand how the company will withstand external changes and make important internal decisions.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing Decisions in Special Circumstances</h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">1. Pricing in Periods of Recession:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Firms may sell below total cost but above marginal cost for a limited period. Advantages: retain skilled employees, prevent plant deterioration, ready for recovery, avoid competition. Avoid drastic cuts or long-term orders.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">2. Pricing Below Marginal Cost:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Justified for limited periods if: materials are perishable, large accumulated stocks (saves carrying cost), to popularize new product (penetration), or to boost sales of other high-profit products.</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600">Note: 'Predatory pricing' (selling below cost to reduce/eliminate competition) is an abuse of dominance and illegal under competition law.</p>

<section id="ethical-non-financial" class="content-section p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Ethical and Non-Financial Considerations</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Pricing policies must consider ethical and non-financial factors for long-term sustainability. Ethical pricing goes beyond legality; it's about moral right/wrong.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Ethical Pricing Issues that Hurt Businesses:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Price Fixing (Collusion/Cartelization):** Agreement among competitors to fix prices (horizontal price fixing is illegal).</li>
        <li>**Price Skimming:** Gradual price reduction over time, where early adopters pay more.</li>
        <li>**Bid Rigging:** Favoritism/collusion in bidding processes, hurting customers indirectly.</li>
        <li>**Price Discrimination:** Selling same product at different prices to different consumer groups.</li>
        <li>**Super Pricing for High Perceived Value:** Charging unjustified high prices for products with high perceived value but low production cost, without disclosure.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-4 mb-2">Non-Financial Considerations:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>Brand image, buyer's attitude.</li>
        <li>Product life cycle stage, intensity of competition.</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Pricing Strategies</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Businesses use various methodologies to set prices. Senior executives must identify pricing position, segment, capability, and competitive reaction strategy.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Price Adaptation Strategies:</h3>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Organizations often have a pricing structure that varies by geographical demand, costs, market segments, purchase timing, etc.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Geographic Pricing:** Price varies by location/country (e.g., compensation deals, barter, buy-back, offset).</li>
        <li>**Discounted Pricing:** Offers discounts for bulk purchases, early payments (distributor's, quantity, cash, seasonal discounts) or allowances.</li>
        <li>**Promotional Pricing:** Techniques to stimulate early purchase (longer payment terms, special event pricing, loss leader pricing, cash rebates, warranties, psychological discounting).</li>
        <li>**Price Discrimination:** Charging different prices based on customer, product, place, or time.</li>
        <li>**Product Mix Pricing:** Maximizes profit on the total product mix.
            <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4">
                <li>**Product Line Pricing:** Introduce price steps for different products in a line.</li>
                <li>**Optional Feature Pricing:** Offers optional features/services with main product.</li>
                <li>**Captive Product Pricing:** Core product low price, profits from ancillary products.</li>
                <li>**Two-part pricing:** Fixed fees + variable usage fees (e.g., landline, amusement parks).</li>
                <li>**By-Product Pricing:** Firms earn by selling by-products, charging lower price on main product.</li>
                <li>**Product Bundling Pricing:** Seller bundles products/features (Pure: only as bundle; Mixed: bundle or individual).</li>

    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">The Kano Model helps prioritize product features based on their impact on customer satisfaction. It defines attributes that influence customer willingness to pay and perceived value.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-2">Attributes:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 space-y-1">
        <li>**Threshold attributes (Must-be qualities - M):** Taken for granted when met, cause dissatisfaction when not met (e.g., touch screen on a smartphone).</li>
        <li>**Performance attributes (One-dimensional qualities - O):** Lead to proportionate increase in satisfaction as investment increases; customers know what they want (e.g., battery life).</li>
        <li>**Excitement or Delight attributes (Attractive qualities - A):** Provide satisfaction when met, but no dissatisfaction when not met; unexpected "wow" factor (e.g., seat upgrade on a flight).</li>
        <li>**Indifferent qualities (I):** Neither good nor bad, no effect on satisfaction (e.g., logo placement).</li>
        <li>**Reverse qualities (R):** Lead to dissatisfaction if present, no satisfaction if absent (e.g., pop-up messages).</li>
        <li>**Questionable attribute (Q):** Ambiguous feature, presence is doubtful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">Customer expectations change over time; excitement attributes can become performance or threshold attributes. Businesses should focus on including Basic, Performance, and Excitement attributes, while excluding Indifference, Reverse, and Questionable ones.</p>
